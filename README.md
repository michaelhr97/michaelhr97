Hello, I'm **@michaelhr97**! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm a **telecommunications engineer** 📡 with a degree from the Polytechnic University of Madrid. During my studies I had a significant epiphany - my **true passion** 😍 lay in the world of **software** 👨‍💻. While telecommunications provided me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and attention to detail, it was the act of crafting code and building software solutions that truly ignited my enthusiasm.

This realization prompted me to take a leap into the programming world 🌍, where I've embraced the challenges and rewards of creating software. My journey now includes learning more about backend development and cloud computing, as well as pursuing advanced studies in Web Engineering to refine my software design skills 🖌️.

I bring over **+2 years of experience** 💼 in the technology sector, where I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that have sharpened my skills and deepened my passion for programming. During my professional journey, **I've been actively involved in the creation of chatbots** 🤖. I've had the opportunity to build chatbots that streamline communication and enhance user experiences.

Also, **I've been actively engaged in backend development** ⚒️. Creating new endpoints has been a key aspect of my backend work. I've crafted APIs that enable seamless communication between frontend and backend components, providing the necessary functionality for web applications to thrive. These endpoints have been instrumental in delivering enhanced user experiences and expanding the capabilities of the projects I've been a part of.
